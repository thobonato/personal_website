Originally from Brazil ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡·, I've lived across Australia ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡º, Costa Rica ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡·, and the US ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸. I am currently studying Artificial Intelligence for Business at USC in LA, where I also help lead the university's flagship startup incubator, supporting 10+ companies.</p>
            <p className="py-2">My journey with tech began at 13 when I built Clevr LMS. Since then, I've loved hacking away at problems and working on different projects. Outside of tech, I love playing tennis, basketball, exploring nature, lifting or just chilling with friends.</p>
